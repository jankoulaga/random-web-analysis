A random web page analysis application

Query this web service 100 times: 
http://www.randomwebsite.com/cgi-bin/random.pl 

The response contains a short HTML document with one link inside. Query this link and store link URL, as well as the returned HTTP response codes in a suitable data structure.
The application should output a list of all link URLs ordered by the first character of the domain name (ignore http:// and www prefixes) and also print the related HTTP Code, if itâ€™s not 200.

The project does all the work using Actor system to create an Actor which gathers all the results by creating child actors which do the actual url visit.
